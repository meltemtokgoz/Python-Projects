# Movie-Reviews

Movie reviews are a fairly commonly used tool used by consumers to understand if a movie is worth the price and time. 
There are different methods to create reviews about movies. One of them is rating the movies by different users. 
GroupLens Research has collected and made available rating datasets from the MovieLens web site (http://movielens.org).
We used extra information about movies, Dennis Schwartz’s reviews.

In this assignment, you will implement a python program that analyzes GroupLens’ data and compares them with Dennis Schwartz’s reviews.
This program will create html files for movies which are both in Dennis Schwartz’s reviews and in GroupLens’ data
and try to guess genres of movies based on the data which obtained from movies.
